# calculateMean-on-JS
Calculate mean value throught inputs

Create more inputs as it fits (to add more values throughout the calculation) but don't forget to change it on js and change the formula (grade 1 + ...grade N / N) 
being N = number of inputs/values

the range to calculate the mean value is 0 to 10 which can also be changed on js
